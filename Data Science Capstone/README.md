# Directory purpose

This directory holds all my work made for all the steps required to complete the [capstone project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-science-project?), which is the last of the 10 courses in the [Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science) from Johns Hopkins University.

# Project Overview

Around the world, people are spending an increasing amount of time on their mobile devices for email, social networking, banking and a whole range of other activities. But typing on mobile devices can be a serious pain. SwiftKey, the corporate partner in this capstone, builds a smart keyboard that makes it easier for people to type on their mobile devices. One cornerstone of their smart keyboard is predictive text models.

This work starts with the basics, analyzing a large corpus of text documents to discover the structure in the data and how words are put together. It covers cleaning and analyzing text data, then building and sampling from a predictive text model. Finally, the knowledge gained in data products are helpful to build a predictive text product that can be shown off to family, friends, and potential employers.

## Resources

1. Corpus made of 3 texts files, each containing blog posts, tweets and news respectively. Can be downloaded directly from the [coursera course page](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip).  
2. A benchmark program made in R to evaluate the next word prediction algorithm, developed by a peer and all [code available in the dedicated Github page](https://github.com/hfoffani/dsci-benchmark).
